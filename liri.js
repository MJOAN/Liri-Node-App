At the top of the liri.js file, write the code you need to grab the data from keys.js. 
Then store the keys in a variable.
Make it so liri.js can take in one of the following commands:
my-tweets
spotify-this-song
movie-this
do-what-it-says


Using the fs Node package, 
LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and 
then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
It should run spotify-this-song for "I Want it That Way," as
 follows the text in random.txt.
Feel free to change the text in that document to 
test out the feature for other commands.
